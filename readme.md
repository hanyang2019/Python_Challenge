* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

Create a Python script to analyze a set of poll data, [election_data.csv](PyPoll/election_data.csv), in order to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate` and will be analyzed to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

## PyBoss
Create a Python script to convert employee records of a company, [employee_data.csv](PyBoss/employee_data.csv), to the required format. The dataset is comprised of five columns: `Emp ID`,`Name`,`DOB`,`SSN` and `State`. The required conversions are as follows:
* The `Name` column should be split into separate `First Name` and `Last Name` columns.
* The `DOB` data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
* The `SSN` data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
* The `State` data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations.
